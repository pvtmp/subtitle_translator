00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,135
Juliette
is in real danger, Nick,

184
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,603
and we don't have much time.

185
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:06,639
- Who's Juliette?
- Oh, wow, so you two

186
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:09,025
really haven't caught up
in any significant way, I guess.

187
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,360
Juliette's my girlfriend.

188
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,028
And she's in a coma
because of a hexenbiest.

189
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,413
The hexenbiest
that Nick destroyed

190
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:15,398
with our help, by the way,
just, you know, for the record.

191
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,000
Nick, the spell is called
<i>l'esprit ailleurs.</i>

192
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,485
Literall spirit elsewhere.

193
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,087
Oddly apropos.
It causes memory loss

194
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,706
with symptoms
similar to dementia.

195
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:25,158
So it's imperative
thate stop the progression,

196
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:26,793
like, asap.
Right now.

197
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,011
But we have
all the ingredients.

198
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,629
We have them mixed,
and they're cooking,

199
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,214
but it takes 16 hours
for it to be ready.

200
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,266
Well, will it bring her
out of the coma?

201
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:34,500
It's way more complicated.

202
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,137
Our first step is just
to stop the memory loss.

203
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:40,140
Okay, just do
whatever you have to do.

204
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,559
I'm just... I'm so sorry
this happened to Juliette.

205
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,279
And, uh... Sort of nice
to meet you.

206
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:50,233
Dude, I gotta be honest,

207
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:53,203
your mother
scares the crap out of me, man.

208
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,791
Look, you two should probably
just keep your distance

209
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,292
until I figure out
what I'm dealing with in there.

210
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,378
Yeah. No. Totally, I mean,
family reunions can be brutal.

211
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,747
Our last one, we lost
two cousins and a sheepdog.

212
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,048
- Okay.
- I mean,

213
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:07,200
no one missed the cousins,
you know, they're...

214
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,739
- this is Juliette.

215
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,678
She's very pretty.

216
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:54,714
How long
have you been together?

217
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,302
Where have you been
for 18 years?

218
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:04,808
More places
than I care to remember.

219
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:07,527
Why don't you try?

220
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,595
I went after
those responsible

221
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,616
for killing your father
and my friend.

222
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,102
For 18 years?

223
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,871
I had no idea
how long it would take

224
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,439
or where it would lead

225
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,492
or how many times
I'd be misled and deceived.

226
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:25,078
When I learned about the secret
order, the dragon's tongue,

227
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:26,546
that they were after the coins,

228
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,548
I knew there was more at stake
than just finding the killers.

229
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,417
I had to deal
with the royal families

230
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:31,835
who are trying
to regain the control

231
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:34,304
they had in the last century.

232
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:35,889
A lot of the turmoil
in the world today

233
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:38,091
is instigated by their agents.

234
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,727
Like the verrat.

235
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:44,064
You're learning.
That's good.

236
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:46,549
I wish I could have been
the one who taught you.

237
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,551
When I learned
that a Grimm had the coins,

238
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:49,936
I was hoping it wasn't you.

239
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,438
I often wonder how I could have

240
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:54,474
done things differently
that night, but...

241
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,329
Kimura led me to you,
and that's all that matters.

242
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:00,847
What about the coins?

243
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:03,616
They've already taken up
too much of our lives.

244
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,452
They need to be destroyed.

245
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:07,003
The sooner you give them
to me, the better.

246
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,155
It's the only way
I can protect you now.

247
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,332
[Knocking at door]

248
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:23,520
Where's adalind?

249
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:24,521
Why would you think
I know where she is?

250
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,838
You're her mother.

251
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:28,641
Well, that's a little
old-school, even for you.

252
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,009
She's gone.

253
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,394
She played
one last little trick.

254
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,063
She put Nick's girlfriend
in a coma.

255
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:34,948
And I care about that why?

256
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,283
Because it concerns me.

257
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:39,569
Can you really blame adalind
after what he did to her?

258
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,454
Yes!

259
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,190
She should stay out of things
that she does not understand.

260
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,858
Well, maybe you
played with her heart

261
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,161
a little too freely,
and that confused her.

262
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:50,663
No, she knew exactly
what she was doing.

263
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,748
Why do you care what happens

264
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:53,516
to detective Burkhardt's
girlfriend?

265
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:57,137
Because she ties him here...

266
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,855
To Portland, to me,

267
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,873
and if she dies, he could
quit the force, he could leave,

268
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,710
and I have put too much time
and effort into him

269
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,812
to allow that to happen.

270
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,848
Now, I need to know
what adalind did.

271
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:14,571
A Grimm on his own
is dangerous for all of us.

272
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,990
And I'm holding you
personally responsible,

273
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:19,058
and believe me,

274
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,244
you don't want that.

275
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,393
That's amazing...
based on a pair of boots

276
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,112
you could find out
where the guy lived.

277
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,348
Yeah. And his cabin
is way out there.

278
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,684
I don't think Nick could have
found it without me.

279
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,636
You went there with Nick?

280
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,438
I thought you went there
with Hank.

281
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,308
I did.

282
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,360
Yeah.

283
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,602
Nick?

284
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:26,759
[Roars]

285
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,956
Oh, crap, the toast.

286
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,875
I got it.

287
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,327
Thanks.

288
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:03,179
I was just trying to

289
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,165
make you a little...
Something.

290
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:08,017
[Cell phone ringing] I'm sorry.

291
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,219
For what?

292
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,106
A lot of things on that list.

293
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,390
Burkhardt.

294
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,442
Where?

295
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,363
On my way.

296
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:22,682
So I've got an investigation.

297
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,733
Gotta run.

298
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,373
You gonna be here
when I get back?

299
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,958
Yes.

300
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:44,721
Hey.
How you holding up?

301
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,306
All right.

302
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,724
It's gonna be okay, man.

303
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,375
Juliette's gonna
come out of it, she's strong.

304
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,144
Well, I hope you're right.

305
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,345
I am.

306
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:56,048
I may not be awake,
but I'm right.

307
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,914
Who's the ship registered to?

308
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,333
Holding company
based in Rotterdam.

309
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh, it's a foreign ship.

310
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:15,618
The feds are gonna have
jurisdiction.

311
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:16,619
Have they been notified?
Yeah.

312
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,954
They're on their way.

313
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:19,038
Who reported it?

314
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,540
Harbor master
was called last night.

315
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:23,176
Three of them went inside.
Nobody came out.

316
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,762
Bodies weren't discovered
until 6:15 this morning

317
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:27,463
by one of the security guards.

318
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:28,914
He was pretty shook up
by what he saw,

319
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:32,418
and I gotta tell you,
this one is, uh...

320
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,771
Well, I hate to ruin
the surprise.

321
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,281
What the hell did this?

322
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,268
Something
out of my worst nightmare.

323
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,609
I don't think
this container was used

324
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:59,445
to lock anyone out.

325
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,947
It was used
to lock something in.

326
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:12,039
Found out the container was
loaded at le havre two weeks ago.

327
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,168
Name on the ship manifest
is G.Q.R. Industries.

328
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:16,419
Who are they,
and what do they do?

329
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:17,754
It looks like
a holding company.

330
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:20,140
We don't know much more
than that.

331
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:22,509
We contacted French police.
Waiting on a reply.

332
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,678

Uhhuh.

333
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:25,679
Yeah?

Sir, the FBI agents are here.

335
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,132
Send 'em in.

336
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,466
You know the feds
are taking over this, right?

337
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:31,735
Sir, I think
that might be a mistake.

338
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,819
It's not up to us.

339
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:33,904
Just collect
whatever you've done,

340
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:35,572
pass it to them.

Hell of a mess
we're giving you.

345
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,697
Yeah, we just
came from down there.

346
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,832
You did a fine job
securing the location.

347
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,751
Yeah, we appreciate it.
What do you got for us?

348

All the prelim we could get.

349
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,155
Look, we might
be able to be of some help.

350
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,291
That's okay, detective,
we'll take it from here.

351
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,992
We've already got a line:
Security guard's truck

352
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,677
was stolen last night
from the docks.

353
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,212
If this killer's driving it,
we'll get him.

354
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,014
Well, I understand that,
there are aspects of this ca...

355
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:03,266
- hey, Nick.

356
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,101
Detective.

357
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,855
Thank you.

358
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,891
Gentlemen.

359
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,483
Here's how it's gonna go.

360
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:23,436
First thing tomorrow, you'll be
arraigned for double homicide.

361
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:25,355
A few hours after that,
you'll be transferred

362
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:26,957
to a maximum security facility,

363
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,775
ere you will await trial,
be found guilty,

364
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,744
and sentenced to death.

365
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:32,245
Now, obviously, I will derive

366
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,630
a certain amount
of pleasure from that,

367
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:35,932
seeing as I can't
attend to you myself.

368
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,303
Then maybe
you shouldn't have arrested me.

369
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,322
If I'd have
gotten to you first,

370
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,940
I wouldn't have.

371
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,926
Why are you here?

372
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:53,066
I've seen the tattoos
on your back.

373
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,152
I know who you're working for.

374
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,438
Too bad you didn't know you were
going up against a Grimm.

375
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:02,826
So you know what I am.

376
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,395
It would have been
better for you

377
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,448
had you known whatiam.

378
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,917
At least now I know
who has the coins.

379
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:14,404
I would have gotten them.

380
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,739
I knew there was one Grimm.

381
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:18,842
I didn't know there were two.

382
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,617
Mom?

383
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:47,904
I did a little cleaning up.

384
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:49,906
Sorry, habit.

385
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,575
Right.

386
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,161
- Hope it's okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,813
Thanks.

388
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:02,952
Hey, look. I've been thinking
about everything,

389
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,604
and...

390
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:06,906
I think I need to
take you somewhere.

391
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:18,852
I never thought
I'd see this again.

392
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,940
You know about this?

393
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:25,608
Marie and I
bought this trailer

394
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:26,860
when our dad got sick.

395
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:29,362
We needed
a place to hide everything

396
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,748
that had been
passed down to us.

397
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,584
We had 17 trunks hidden
in the basement of our house.

398
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:38,004
Who else in our family
had this...

399
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,172
Problem?

400
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:41,674
That I know of?

401
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,676
Your grandfather,

402
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:46,679
your great-grandmother,
and aunt Marie.

403
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:48,664
- And Uncle George had it too?
- No.

404
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,500
Not everyone does.

405
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:53,186
In fact, nobody knows
when it's gonna hit them

406
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,554
or even if they've got it.

407
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,890
Women become aware sooner
than men, but the only thing

408
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,725
we know for sure is
it's inherited.

409
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,192
There are a lot of people

410
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,212
who'd like to get their hands
on this stuff.

411
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:24,250
What did you think when
you first found out about...

412
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:26,035
You know, all of this?

413
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:28,421
I was only ten years old.

414
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:32,375
Your grandfather didn't even
try to protect me,

415
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,227
so as soon as the nightmares
started, he wanted me

416
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:38,181
to know exactly what I was
gonna be up against.

417
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:44,220
I was so scared,
I didn't sleep for months.

418
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:46,722
When I turned 18,

419
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,993
he took Marie and me
on the hunts.

420
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,727
The first couple
were horrifying,

421
00:24:51,745 --> 00:24:53,729
but, uh, we quickly realized

422
00:24:53,747 --> 00:24:59,252
that we were doing
what had to be done.

423
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:03,256
We spent hours
poring over these books.

[Inhales]

425
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,096
You know, I...

426
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:11,581
I never wanted this for you.

427
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,851
It's not as if
you had much of a choice.

428
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,755
Lot of history here.

429
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:26,696
Your great-great-grandmother
hilda, with this blade,

430
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,282
castrated a rotznasig carcaju.

You know, this is all
very important to us.

434
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:13,976
Now what?

435
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,145
Uh...

436
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:17,664
Return them
to the island of zakynthos,

437
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:18,915
where they were forged.

438
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:22,669
It's the only way
to destroy them.

439
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:26,372
So I guess you'll be leaving.

440
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:29,425
You know what, I guess
I understand more now than...

441
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:37,467
look, you know, I have seen

442
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,502
a lot of things.

443
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:43,273
I mean, I cannot judge

444
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:45,458
the decisions
that you had to make.

445
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:47,944
But you know, I just wish
I didn't have to

446

447
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:53,283
So do I.

[Sniffles]

449
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,699
Maybe you can help me.

450
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:11,867
What is it?

451
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,703
An investigation
I'm working on.

452
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:16,923
I want you to look at this.

453
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:17,924
Where is this?

454
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,392
A container on a cargo ship

455
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:20,876
that left le havre
two weeks ago.

456
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,979
Do you know
what the scythe means?

457
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:24,847
Yeah.
Reapers.

458
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:26,599
And you've dealt with one?

459
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,484
Actually,
I've dealt with three.

460
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,069
Was one of them French?

461
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:31,688
We didn't do
too much talking.

462
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:34,274
Then you were the one who
returned the heads to mannheim.

463

465
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,665
No, I don't think
that is reapers.

No, no, no.

467
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,202
No, something else drew those.

468
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:48,454
And if it's
what I think it is...

469
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,743
It's worse than reapers.

470
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,763
I hope I'm wrong about this.

471
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,139
Were there any puncture wounds?

472
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,191
There were a lot of wounds.

473
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:15,365
We need to go.

474

And the few things on her list

538
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,706
are the same that we're using
for Juliette.

539
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,675
So we looked it up
in a couple of rosalee's books,

540
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,576
and we think we figured out
what she's doing.

541
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:33,178

for somebody

but rosalee got her number,
didn't you?

548
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,388
- Yeah.
- Okay, give it to me,

549

from her number.

550

554
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:03,825
Obviously, she doesn't want
anybody to find her.

to reverse

that there are seven keys.

who fought

616

for the seven royal families
in the fourth crusade.

617

Now, when you put the maps
together,

618
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:20,105

where the knights hid

620

they took from constantinople

621
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,412

and burned it.

Well, they needed us.

625

So the wesen
fought for the royals?

626
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:42,043
Yes, and the royals needed
the grimms to control them,

627
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:45,180
as they do now, but there was
one thing in the treasure

628
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:46,381
the knights hid.

629
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:49,101
There was one thing
that was more powerful

630

than anything
anyone had ever seen.

631
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,090
If the royal families
got ahold of it,

632
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:59,277
they could control the world.

pretty well?

Sure, yeah.

636
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:06,785
They made a map,
they cut it into seven pieces,

637
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:10,021
and they gave each knight
a key.

- The royal families.

00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,501
It's ready, but it's, like,
unstable or something,

715
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,670
and it's only gonna be good
for, like...

716
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,139
- another 45 more minutes,
give or take,

717
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,191
and if we don't make it,
we have to start from scratch.

718
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,176
Just meet us at the hospital,
okay?

719
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:04,528
We're leaving right now.

720
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:05,896
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

721
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,013
Nick, what's wrong?

722
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:10,033
Can't get into it right now.

00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:29,253

724
